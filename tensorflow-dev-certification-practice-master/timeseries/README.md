# Time series, sequences and predictions

You need to understand how to solve time series and forecasting problems in TensorFlow.You need to
know how to:

* Train, tune and use time series, sequence and prediction models.
* Prepare data for time series learning.
* Understand Mean Average Error (MAE) and how it can be used to evaluate accuracy of
sequence models.
* Use RNNs and CNNs for time series, sequence and forecasting models.
* Identify when to use trailing versus centred windows.
* Use TensorFlow for forecasting.
* Prepare features and labels.
* Identify and compensate for sequence bias.
* Adjust the learning rate dynamically in time series, sequence and prediction models.
